# mdb2sqlite
A script I used to convert legacy Access '97 Databases to SQLite for viewing/cross validation against new system.

The code has exessive ammounts of commits and try statements because I wanted to save as much of the new database as possible without crashing the program and losing most of the progress. As a result, it runs slow-ish so be patient.
